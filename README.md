# Rock_and_Mine_Prediction1
Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression  This project demonstrates how to build a Machine Learning model in Python that predicts whether an object is a Rock or a Mine using SONAR dataset. The classification task is performed using a Logistic Regression model, a simple yet powerful algorithm for binary classification problems
