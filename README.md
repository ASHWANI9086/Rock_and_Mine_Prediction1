# Rock_and_Mine_Prediction1
Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression  This project demonstrates how to build a Machine Learning model in Python that predicts whether an object is a Rock or a Mine using SONAR dataset. The classification task is performed using a Logistic Regression model, a simple yet powerful algorithm for binary classification problems


📘 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify objects based on SONAR signal data.
Each object is represented by 60 numerical features corresponding to energy returns at different angles.

Using Logistic Regression, the model learns to distinguish between rocks and mines with high accuracy.

🧠 Key Steps
1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing

The dataset used is the SONAR Dataset (from the UCI Machine Learning Repository).

Loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

Explored using .describe(), .shape, and .value_counts() to understand data distribution.

The target column (60) contains labels:

R → Rock

M → Mine
